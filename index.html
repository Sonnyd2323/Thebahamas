        <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>Lucayan Indians inhabited the islands when Christopher COLUMBUS first set foot in the New World on San Salvador in 1492. British settlement of the islands began in 1647; the islands became a colony in 1783. Piracy thrived in the 17th and 18th centuries because of The Bahamas close proximity to shipping lanes.</p>

          <p>Since attaining independence from the UK in 1973, The Bahamas has prospered through tourism, international banking, and investment management, which comprise up to 85% of GDP.</p>

          <p>Because of its proximity to the US, the nearest Bahamian landmass being only 80 km (50 mi) from Florida, the country is a major transshipment point for illicit trafficking, particularly to the US mainland, as well as Europe.</p>

          <p>US law enforcement agencies cooperate closely with The Bahamas, and the US Coast Guard assists Bahamian authorities in maritime security and law enforcement through Operation Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, or OPBAT.</p>
